# OS X Shortcuts

Did you know pressing **⌘⇧⌥V** pastes text without its formatting?
Or that **⇧⌥-** makes an em dash (—)?
Well, most people don’t, but it’d save them time if they did!

Lists of OS X keyboard shortcuts exist in the [usual places](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201236), but they are mostly both incomplete and a slog to read through.
Here they are in one page, organized roughly so *more useful ones are at the front*.
We cover shortcuts for OS X that work in many apps or in Finder, but not shortcuts for individual apps.
Note these are the **default settings**.
Global shortcuts [can be reassigned](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18415) and if assigned in conflicting ways [may stop working](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18424).
This is an “**open guide**,” so you see any ways this can be improved, **[please contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)**!

## The Keys

Mac hardware conventionally uses several **modifier keys**, which
[can be reassigned](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18422) to different physical keys if desired, and a couple other special keys:

**⌘** Command (Windows logo on PC keyboards)  
**⇧** Shift  
**⌥** Option (Alt on PC keyboards)  
**⌃** Control  
**⇪** Caps Lock  
**Fn** Function  

**⌫** Delete  
**⌽** Power

## Input Methods and Special Characters

You can write common Unicode symbols, punctuation, and accented letters with shortcuts.
The [keyboard viewer](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21565) will allow you to discover them, or fall back to the [character viewer](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201586).

### Input

- Use **⌘⌃Space** for the **[emoji and special character pop-up](http://www.engadget.com/2013/12/13/this-is-the-most-important-mavericks-keyboard-shortcut-youll-di/)**. This is the quickest way for most to find special characters.
- You can switch to different **language keyboards** by adding new [input source](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21564).
Once multiple inputs are enabled, use the menu to select or **^⌥Space**.
- Pressing **Fn** **Fn** will start voice dictation if you [enable this feature](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202584).
- Enable the “Unicode Hex Input” keyboard to [enter Unicode inputs by hex code](https://gigaom.com/2011/04/26/quick-tip-type-unicode-characters-quickly/).

### Accents

You can **type accents by [holding down keys](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201586)**, unless you [disable that feature](http://lifehacker.com/5826055/make-your-keyboard-keys-repeat-properly-when-held-down-in-mac-os-x-lion).
You can also type accents by pressing one of these modifier keys before a suitable letter (for example, **⌥I o** yields the letter *ô*):

**⌥E** Acute ´ &nbsp;&nbsp;
**⌥I** Circumflex ˆ &nbsp;&nbsp;
**⌥`** Grave \` &nbsp;&nbsp;
**⌥N** Tilde ˜ &nbsp;&nbsp;
**⌥U** Umlaut ¨


### Punctuation


Enter an **[em dash](http://www.thepunctuationguide.com/em-dash.html)** (—) with **⇧⌥-**  
Enter an **[en dash](http://www.thepunctuationguide.com/en-dash.html)** (–) with **⌥-**

**Open and close quotes**: &nbsp; **⌥[** “ &nbsp; **⇧⌥[** ” &nbsp; **⌥]** ‘ &nbsp; **⇧⌥]** ’ &nbsp;
**⌥/** « &nbsp; **⇧⌥/** »  
(These are not the same as the ASCII characters " and '. If you’re confused, read more about [typographical conventions](http://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html).)

Some other special character shortcuts:  
**⌥G** © &nbsp;
**⌥R** ® &nbsp;
**⌥2** ™ &nbsp;
**⌥7** ¶ &nbsp;
**⌥8** • &nbsp;
**⇧⌥8** ° &nbsp;

The list above is not exhaustive, but you can learn additional ones via the **[keyboard viewer](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21565)** or these lists of [regular](http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemac.html) and [extended](http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemacext.html) shortcuts.
